# DNA Sequence Analyzer

A Python package for analyzing DNA sequences including basic operations like GC content calculation and sequence translation.

## Installation

```bash
pip install .



Future Enhancements
-------------------

The goal of this package is to house a collection of tools helpful for DNA sequence analysis.
Over time, more tools will be added such as:

- Sequence Alignment
    Identifying similarities and differences between DNA sequences.

- Gene Prediction
    Identifying regions of the DNA that are likely to be genes.

- Motif Finding
    Identifying recurring sequence patterns (motifs) that have biological significance.

- Pathogen Detection
    Identifying and characterizing pathogens from DNA sequences.
